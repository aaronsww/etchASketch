# Etch-A-Sketch

<a href="https://aaronsww.github.io/etchASketch">Live Demonstration.</a>

## Project Summary

In this project, I made a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. I learned many new JavaScript methods and new ways to manipulate the DOM with creative ways to add CSS.

### Functionality:

<ul>
    <li>Select a color from the color picker to sketch with.</li>
    <li>Sketch with a vast array of colors at once using "Rainbow".</li>
    <li>It's okay if you've made a mistake, you can always use the erase tool to fix it!</li>
    <li>Clear current exisitng sketch to start a fresh.</li>
    <li>Adjust thickness/ pixel density of your pen by entering a number of your convenience.</li>
</ul>
